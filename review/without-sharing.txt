# Without Sharing #

Our 'UnravelCore' apex class needs to use 'without sharing' due to the fact 
that this class needs to access the global schema describe methods to retrieve
all the objects to be able to render them in the 'Unraveller' application.

We have to be able to show all available object metadata regardless of permission 
so we need the 'without sharing' keyword.

For the other methods in the class, such as 'getConfiguration()' we are 
actually enforcing CRUD sharing checks for each method individually outside 
of the describe methods to make sure we are compliant with sharing on these
records.

We also use 'without sharing' on our 'UnravelStats' class - this is due to 
the fact we need to update Feature Management Parameters, regardless of the 
current user.
