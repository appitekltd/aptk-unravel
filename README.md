# Unravel
Explore and interact with Salesforce data models and architecture in 3D

## About ##
This is the source code for our free [Unravel package](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N3A00000FZLTWUA5)

This package allows you to view all your standard, custom, and external objects, as well as all the relationships between them, all from one 3D interactive data modelling tool.

It does this by retrieving the metadata from Salesforce and rendering it client-side using the 'threejs' javascript framework.

## Bugs ##
If you find any issues please let us know! We try our best to keep our free tools updated and in working order, but cannot be held responsible for any issues that occur from using them.
